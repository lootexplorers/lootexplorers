## Loot Explorers Resources ðŸ› 

Loot Explorers are 8000 unique explorer characters decked out with gear found in the first 8000 genesis bags of loot. Putting a twist on the classic RPG style with chunky lines and juicy colors, each Explorer's design is influenced by the loot they carry mixed in with elements such as distinct classes & cool backdrops, all attached to uniquely generated name.
